# Rows-of-maps mutation

Experiments to help me think about possible additional mutation APIs for R nested dataframes.

In Clojure rather than R to encourage thinking about vectors of maps rather than maps of vectors.

## Usage

Requires Clojure to be installed.

Start with nREPL: 

```
./nrepl.sh
```

In REPL, `-main` is a demo of the functions.
